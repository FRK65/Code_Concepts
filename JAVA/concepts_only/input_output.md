# Main points are :

1. **Scanner** is higher-level and easier for beginners.
2. **BufferedReader** is lower-level, but more efficient.
3. ***`BufferedReader` is faster.**
4. ***`BufferedReader`*** It reads large chunks of characters into a buffer, making fewer system calls.
5.  **`Scanner`** does more behind the scenes (like tokenizing, parsing), which adds overhead.
6.  **Use BufferedReader** for performance-critical input tasks (e.g., competitive programming, large files).
7.  BufferedReader can not read different data types directly (like int, double, etc.)
8.  `BufferedReader` only reads **strings** using `readLine()`.
9. You must manually convert the input using parsing methods:  Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine())
10. For BufferedReader
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
        String word = reader.readLine().split(" ")[0];  // Take the first word only

        System.out.print("Enter a full line: ");
        String line = reader.readLine();
  
        int i = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
    }
}
```
11. When would you prefer using Scanner over BufferedReader, when You're reading **small or interactive input** (like from the user).
12. You want **built-in parsing** (e.g., `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`).
13. You're writing simple console apps, beginner projects, or school assignments.
14. While Use **`BufferedReader`** when: You need **faster input**.
15. You're reading **large data sets** or files.
16. You're doing **line-by-line processing** (like reading logs or config files).
17. purpose of InputStreamReader when using BufferedReader :
18. 🟢 `InputStreamReader` is used to **bridge between byte streams and character streams**.
-  `System.in` is a **byte stream**.
-  `BufferedReader` works with **character streams**.
-  So, `InputStreamReader` converts bytes → characters.
  
19. 🔍 **Think of it like this:**
`System.in` (bytes) → `InputStreamReader` → `BufferedReader` (chars)

| Concept                        | Your Answer                                              | Verdict    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Scanner vs BufferedReader**  | Scanner is easier, BufferedReader is faster              | ✅ Correct  |
| **Speed**                      | BufferedReader is faster due to buffered chunks          | ✅ Correct  |
| **Data type parsing**          | BufferedReader reads strings only; manual parsing needed | ✅ Correct  |
| **When to use Scanner**        | Small input, built-in parsing, beginner-friendly         | ✅ Correct  |
| **When to use BufferedReader** | Large input, performance-critical, line-by-line reading  | ✅ Correct  |
| **InputStreamReader purpose**  | Converts byte stream (System.in) to character stream     | ✅ Perfect! |

You’re clearly **ready to use both in real problems**. 💪

### ✅ **Your Code Snippet for BufferedReader**

You're using it correctly, including:

* Importing the right classes
* Wrapping `System.in` with `InputStreamReader`
* Using `readLine()`
* Converting string input to integer via `Integer.parseInt()`

All ✅ Good!

### ✅ **1. What is the main difference between Scanner and BufferedReader in Java?**

| Feature        | `Scanner`                                 | `BufferedReader`                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input Handling | Built-in parsing (e.g., `nextInt()`)      | Reads only strings (`readLine()`), manual parsing needed |
| Usage          | Easy to use for simple input              | Slightly more complex, faster for large input            |
| Token Handling | Can split input into tokens automatically | Doesn't split input (manual splitting needed)            |

🟩 **Summary**:

* **Scanner** is higher-level and easier for beginners.
* **BufferedReader** is lower-level, but more efficient.

---

### ✅ **2. Which one is faster for reading input: Scanner or BufferedReader? Why?**

**🟢 Answer: `BufferedReader` is faster.**

**Why?**

* It reads large chunks of characters into a buffer, making fewer system calls.
* `Scanner` does more behind the scenes (like tokenizing, parsing), which adds overhead.

✅ **Use BufferedReader** for performance-critical input tasks (e.g., competitive programming, large files).

---

### ✅ **3. Can BufferedReader read different data types directly (like int, double, etc.)?**

**🟥 No, it cannot.**

* `BufferedReader` only reads **strings** using `readLine()`.
* You must manually convert the input using parsing methods:

```java
int i = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
double d = Double.parseDouble(reader.readLine());
boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(reader.readLine());
```

---

### ✅ **4. When would you prefer using Scanner over BufferedReader?**

Use **`Scanner`** when:

* You're reading **small or interactive input** (like from the user).
* You want **built-in parsing** (e.g., `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`).
* You're writing simple console apps, beginner projects, or school assignments.

Use **`BufferedReader`** when:

* You need **faster input**.
* You're reading **large data sets** or files.
* You're doing **line-by-line processing** (like reading logs or config files).

---

### ✅ **5. What's the purpose of InputStreamReader when using BufferedReader?**

🟢 `InputStreamReader` is used to **bridge between byte streams and character streams**.

* `System.in` is a **byte stream**.
* `BufferedReader` works with **character streams**.
* So, `InputStreamReader` converts bytes → characters.

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```

🔍 **Think of it like this:**

* `System.in` (bytes) → `InputStreamReader` → `BufferedReader` (chars)
